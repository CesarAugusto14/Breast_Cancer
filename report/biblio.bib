It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against "gold-standard" hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. Hum.

   abstract = {Brain extraction is an important first step in many magnetic resonance neuroimaging studies. Due to variability in brain morphology and in the appearance of the brain due to differences in scanner acquisition parameters, the development of a generally applicable brain extraction algorithm has proven challenging. Learning-based brain extraction algorithms in particular perform well when the target and training images are sufficiently similar, but often perform worse when this condition is not met. In this study, we propose a new patch-based multi-atlas segmentation method for brain extraction which is specifically developed for accurate and robust processing across datasets. Using a diverse collection of labeled images from 5 different datasets, extensive comparisons were made with 9 other commonly used brain extraction methods, both before and after applying error correction (a machine learning method for automatically correcting seg-mentation errors) to each method. The proposed method performed equal to or better than the other methods in each of two segmentation scenarios: a challenging inter-dataset segmentation scenario in which no dataset-specific atlases were used (mean Dice coefficient 98.57%, volu-metric correlation 0.994 across datasets following error correction), and an intra-dataset segmentation scenario in which only dataset-specific atlases were used (mean Dice coefficient 99.02%, volumetric correlation 0.998 across datasets following error correction). Furthermore, combined with error correction, the proposed method runs in less than one-tenth of the time required by the other top-performing methods in the challenging inter-dataset comparisons. Validation on an independent multi-centre dataset also confirmed the excellent performance of the proposed method.

It plays a pivotal role in scenarios in which the amount of high-quality ground-truth data is limited, and acquiring new examples is costly and time-consuming. This is a very common problem in medical image analysis, especially tumor delineation. In this paper, we review the current advances in data-augmentation techniques applied to magnetic resonance images of brain tumors. To better understand the practical aspects of such algorithms, we investigate the papers submitted to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS 2018 edition), as the BraTS dataset became a standard benchmark for validating existent and emerging brain-tumor detection and segmentation techniques. We verify which data augmentation approaches were exploited and what was their impact on the abilities of underlying supervised learners. Finally, we highlight the most promising research directions to follow in order to synthesize high-quality artificial brain-tumor examples which can boost the generalization abilities of deep models.},

   abstract = {Background: In the era of computer-assisted diagnostic tools for various brain diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) covers a large percentage of neuroimaging research, with the main scope being its use in daily practice. However, there has been no study attempting to simultaneously discriminate among Healthy Controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI (cMCI) and stable AD, using features derived from a single modality, namely MRI. New method: Based on preprocessed MRI images from the organizers of a neuroimaging challenge, 3 we attempted to quantify the prediction accuracy of multiple morphological MRI features to simultaneously discriminate among HC, MCI, cMCI and AD. We explored the efficacy of a novel scheme that includes multiple feature selections via Random Forest from subsets of the whole set of features (e.g. whole set, left/right hemisphere etc.), Random Forest classification using a fusion approach and ensemble classification via majority voting. From the ADNI database, 60 HC, 60 MCI, 60 cMCI and 60 CE were used as a training set with known labels. An extra dataset of 160 subjects (HC: 40, MCI: 40, cMCI: 40 and AD: 40) was used as an external blind validation dataset to evaluate the proposed machine learning scheme. Results: In the second blind dataset, we succeeded in a four-class classification of 61.9% by combining MRI-based features with a Random Forest-based Ensemble Strategy. We achieved the best classification accuracy of all teams that participated in this neuroimaging competition. Comparison with existing method(s): The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to simultaneously discriminate among four groups using morphological MRI features for the very first time in the literature. Conclusions: Hence, the proposed machine learning scheme can be used to define single and multi-modal biomarkers for AD.},

We studied the three-dimensional movements and energetics of great frigate birds (Fregata minor) and showed that they can stay aloft for months during transoceanic flights. To do this, birds track the edge of the doldrums to take advantage of favorable winds and strong convection. Locally, they use a roller-coaster flight, relying on thermals and wind to soar within a 50- to 600-meter altitude band under cumulus clouds and then glide over kilometers at low energy costs. To deal with the local scarcity of clouds and gain longer gliding distances, birds regularly soar inside cumulus clouds to use their strong updraft, and they can reach altitudes of 4000 meters, where freezing conditions occur.},

   abstract = {Background: Distinguishing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) regions in clinical biopsies constitutes a diagnostic challenge. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an in situ capturing method, which allows quantification and visualization of transcriptomes in individual tissue sections. In the past, studies have shown that breast cancer samples can be used to study their transcriptomes with spatial resolution in individual tissue sections. Previously, supervised machine learning methods were used in clinical studies to predict the clinical outcomes for cancer types. Methods: We used four publicly available ST breast cancer datasets from breast tissue sections annotated by pathologists as non-malignant, DCIS, or IDC. We trained and tested a machine learning method (support vector machine) based on the expert annotation as well as based on automatic selection of cell types by their transcriptome profiles. Results: We identified expression signatures for expert annotated regions (non-malignant, DCIS, and IDC) and build machine learning models. Classification results for 798 expression signature transcripts showed high coincidence with the expert pathologist annotation for DCIS (100%) and IDC (96%). Extending our analysis to include all 25,179 expressed transcripts resulted in an accuracy of 99% for DCIS and 98% for IDC. Further, classification based on an automatically identified expression signature covering all ST spots of tissue sections resulted in prediction accuracy of 95% for DCIS and 91% for IDC. Conclusions: This concept study suggest that the ST signatures learned from expert selected breast cancer tissue sections can be used to identify breast cancer regions in whole tissue sections including regions not trained on. Furthermore, the identified expression signatures can classify cancer regions in tissue sections not used for training with high accuracy. Expert-generated but even automatically generated cancer signatures from ST data might be able to classify breast cancer regions and provide clinical decision support for pathologists in the future.},

Variants of the microglia receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) increase AD risk, and activation of disease-associated microglia (DAM) is dependent on TREM2 in mouse models of AD. We surveyed gene-expression changes associated with AD pathology and TREM2 in 5XFAD mice and in human AD by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We confirmed the presence of Trem2-dependent DAM and identified a previously undiscovered Serpina3n+C4b+ reactive oligodendrocyte population in mice. Interestingly, remarkably different glial phenotypes were evident in human AD. Microglia signature was reminiscent of IRF8-driven reactive microglia in peripheral-nerve injury. Oligodendrocyte signatures suggested impaired axonal myelination and metabolic adaptation to neuronal degeneration. Astrocyte profiles indicated weakened metabolic coordination with neurons. Notably, the reactive phenotype of microglia was less evident in TREM2-R47H and TREM2-R62H carriers than in non-carriers, demonstrating a TREM2 requirement in both mouse and human AD, despite the marked species-specific differences.},

While several tools have been developed for assessing differential expression in sequence-based transcriptomics, the detection of statistical interactions between transcripts has received less attention in the area of RNA-seq analysis. We describe a new extension and assessment of Relief-F for feature selection in RNA-seq data. The ReliefSeq implementation adapts the number of nearest neighbors (k) for each gene to optimize the Relief-F test statistics (importance scores) for finding both main effects and interactions. We compare this gene-wise adaptive-k (gwak) Relief-F method with standard RNA-seq feature selection tools, such as DESeq and edgeR, and with the popular machine learning method Random Forests. We demonstrate performance on a panel of simulated data that have a range of distributional properties reflected in real mRNA-seq data including multiple transcripts with varying sizes of main effects and interaction effects. For simulated main effects, gwak-Relief-F feature selection performs comparably to standard tools DESeq and edgeR for ranking relevant transcripts. For gene-gene interactions, gwak-Relief-F outperforms all comparison methods at ranking relevant genes in all but the highest fold change/highest signal situations where it performs similarly. The gwak-Relief-F algorithm outperforms Random Forests for detecting relevant genes in all simulation experiments. In addition, Relief-F is comparable to the other methods based on computational time. We also apply ReliefSeq to an RNA-Seq study of smallpox vaccine to identify gene expression changes between vaccinia virus-stimulated and unstimulated samples. ReliefSeq is an attractive tool for inclusion in the suite of tools used for analysis of mRNA-Seq data; it has power to detect both main effects and interaction effects.

We have characterized the expression of a large range of ITFs (c-Fos, Fos B, Fos-related antigens, c-Jun, Jun B, Jun D, Krox20, and Krox24) using multiple antisera in AD postmortem hippocampi and compared this with human control hippocampi as well as Huntington's disease hippocampi and human epilepsy biopsy tissue. We found little evidence of nuclear expression of any ITF except c-Jun in the human postmortem tissue, compared with nuclear staining in biopsy tissue. We found some evidence for increased levels of c-Jun and Krox24 protein and krox24 mRNA in the CA1 region of AD hippocampi, suggesting that PCD may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In general, staining characteristics of ITFs varied with different antisera directed against the same protein, indicating the need for caution when interpreting results.},

Hence, finding the association between gene dysfunctions and pathological mechanisms, such as neuronal transports, APP processing, calcium homeostasis, and impairment in mitochondria, should be crucial. Emerging studies have revealed that changes in gene expression and gene regulation may have a strong impact on neurodegeneration. The mRNA–transcription factor interactions, non-coding RNAs, alternative splicing, or copy number variants could also play a role in disease onset. These facts suggest that understanding the impact of transcriptomes in AD may improve the disease diagnosis and also the therapies.

Yet, the pathophysiological processes involved in AD onset and progression are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain could contribute for a better understanding of the AD pathology. In this work, we probed the differential expression of genes in different brain regions of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large transcriptomic studies: Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB), and ROSMAP. Using a combination of differential expression of gene and isoform switch analyses, we provide a detailed landscape of gene expression alterations in the temporal and frontal lobes, harboring brain areas affected at early and late stages of the AD pathology, respectively. Next, we took advantage of an indirect approach to assign the complex gene expression changes revealed in bulk RNAseq to individual cell types/subtypes of the adult brain. This strategy allowed us to identify previously overlooked gene expression changes in the brain of AD patients. Among these alterations, we show isoform switches in the AD causal gene amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and the risk gene bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), which could have important functional consequences in neuronal cells. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze RNAseq data in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases based on both gene/transcript expression and regional/cell-type specificities.</p>},

Open-access databases of RNA microarrays from the peripheral blood and brain of AD patients were analyzed after background correction and data normalization; the Limma package was used for differential expression analysis (DEA) through statistical R programming language. Data were corrected with the Benjamini and Hochberg approach, and genes with p-values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. The direction of the change in gene expression was determined by its variation in the log2-fold change between healthy controls and patients. We performed the functional enrichment analysis of GO using goana and topGO-Limma. The functional enrichment analysis of DEGs showed upregulated (UR) pathways: behavior, nervous systems process, postsynapses, enzyme binding; downregulated (DR) were cellular component organization, RNA metabolic process, and signal transduction.

   abstract = {Modern biomedical data mining requires feature selection methods that can (1) be applied to large scale feature spaces (e.g. 'omics' data), (2) function in noisy problems, (3) detect complex patterns of association (e.g. gene-gene interactions), (4) be flexibly adapted to various problem domains and data types (e.g. genetic variants, gene expression, and clinical data) and (5) are computationally tractable. To that end, this work examines a set of filter-style feature selection algorithms inspired by the 'Relief' algorithm, i.e. Relief-Based algorithms (RBAs). We implement and expand these RBAs in an open source framework called ReBATE (Relief-Based Algorithm Training Environment). We apply a comprehensive genetic simulation study comparing existing RBAs, a proposed RBA called MultiSURF, and other established feature selection methods, over a variety of problems. The results of this study (1) support the assertion that RBAs are particularly flexible, efficient, and powerful feature selection methods that differentiate relevant features having univariate, multivariate, epistatic, or heterogeneous associations, (2) confirm the efficacy of expansions for classification vs. regression, discrete vs. continuous features, missing data, multiple classes, or class imbalance, (3) identify previously unknown limitations of specific RBAs, and (4) suggest that while MultiSURF∗ performs best for explicitly identifying pure 2-way interactions, MultiSURF yields the most reliable feature selection performance across a wide range of problem types.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Transcriptional studies suggest Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves dysfunction of many cellular pathways, including synaptic transmission, cytoskeletal dynamics, energetics, and apoptosis. Despite known progression of AD pathologies, it is unclear how such striking regional vulnerability occurs, or which genes play causative roles in disease progression. METHODS To address these issues, we performed a large-scale transcriptional analysis in the CA1 and relatively less vulnerable CA3 brain regions of individuals with advanced AD and nondemented controls. In our study, we assessed differential gene expression across region and disease status, compared our results to previous studies of similar design, and performed an unbiased co-expression analysis using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Several disease genes were identified and validated using qRT-PCR. RESULTS We find disease signatures consistent with several previous microarray studies, then extend these results to show a relationship between disease status and brain region. Specifically, genes showing decreased expression with AD progression tend to show enrichment in CA3 (and vice versa), suggesting transcription levels may reflect a region's vulnerability to disease. Additionally, we find several candidate vulnerability (ABCA1, MT1H, PDK4, RHOBTB3) and protection (FAM13A1, LINGO2, UNC13C) genes based on expression patterns. Finally, we use a systems-biology approach based on WGCNA to uncover disease-relevant expression patterns for major cell types, including pathways consistent with a key role for early microglial activation in AD. CONCLUSIONS These results paint a picture of AD as a multifaceted disease involving slight transcriptional changes in many genes between regions, coupled with a systemic immune response, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. Despite this complexity, we find that a consistent picture of gene expression in AD is emerging.},

   abstract = {<p>Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.</p>},

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

@article{SMOTE,
   abstract = {<p>An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.</p>},
